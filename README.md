# Capstone-Proposal

Using Supervised Learning to identify whether a car is worth or not on its with respect to its features. \

#Project: Capstone Project

Install This project requires Python 2.x and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy Pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Total number of records are 1728 and 7 columns. And the number of cars that are acceptable(worthy) are 518 and number of cars that are unacceptable(unworthy) are 1210. Here Target is our target variable which tells whether it is worth or not.
